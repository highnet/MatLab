%% General Hints:
% If you want to check your implementation you can:
% -) Set a breakpoint to access variables at a certain point in the script.
% You can inspect their contents in the 'Workspace' window to the right.
% -) Leave out the ';' at the end of a statement/line so the result will be
% printed out in the command window.
% -) Do not rename the predefined variables, or else our test-system won't
% work (which is bad for both parties ;) )

%% Triangles
% 1) Construct 3 Vectors representing 3 Points that define a triangle.
% Implement this task in the function 'define_triangle'.
[P1, P2, P3] = define_triangle();


% 2) Construct the 3 vectors of the triangle: P1P2, P2P3 and P3P1.
% Implement this task in the function 'define_edges'.
[P1P2, P2P3, P3P1] = define_edges(P1, P2, P3);

% 3) Calculate the length of each edge
% Implement this task in the function 'compute_length'.
P1P2_length = compute_length(P1P2);
P2P3_length = compute_length(P2P3);
P3P1_length = compute_length(P3P1);

% 4) Compute the face normal of the triangle and its normalized version.
% Implement this task in the function 'compute_normal'.
[normal, normalized_normal] = compute_normal(P1P2, P2P3, P3P1);

% 5) Compute the Area of your triangle with the face normal.
% Implement this task in the function 'compute_area'.

% 6) Calculate the 3 angles of your triangle (in degrees).
% Implement this task in the function 'compute_angles'.

% The positive length or magnitude of a vector is also known as the euclidian

% get by using the built-in Matlab function 'norm'.

% Compute the face normal and of the triangle its normalized equivalent.
